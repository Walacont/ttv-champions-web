      "a1": "In short: <strong>XP (Dedication)</strong> are permanent points you earn from training and exercises that you never lose. They determine your rank. <strong>Elo (Skill)</strong> is your playing strength that you win or lose in matches. <strong>Season Points</strong> are temporary for the 6-week competition and reset afterwards.",
      "q2": "How does the Elo system work?",
      "a2_intro": "The Elo system calculates your playing strength based on your match results. The more games you play, the more stable your rating becomes.",
      "a2_factor": "Your personal factor (A-Factor):",
      "a2_f1": "<strong>Games 1-10:</strong> Factor 32 (quick calibration)",
      "a2_f2": "<strong>Games 11-20:</strong> Factor 24 (stabilization)",
      "a2_f3": "<strong>From game 21:</strong> Factor 16 (stable ranking)",
      "a2_f4": "<strong>Youth (U21):</strong> Factor 20 (permanently increased)",
      "a2_note": "New players start at 800 Elo. The higher factor at the beginning ensures you quickly reach your true level.",
      "q3": "How do I rise in rank?",
      "a3": "To rise in rank (e.g., from 🔰 Recruit to 🥉 Bronze), you must meet <strong>two conditions</strong>: a minimum level of <strong>XP (Dedication)</strong> and a minimum level of <strong>Elo (Skill)</strong>. For the very first promotion to Bronze, you must also complete 5 basic exercises.",
      "q4": "What is a \"Streak\"?",
      "a4": "A \"Streak\" is an attendance series. If you attend training sessions consecutively (per subgroup), you earn bonus XP. Miss a session and your streak for that group resets. Consistency really pays off!",

You start with <strong>1200 Elo points</strong>. You gain Elo by winning competitive matches against others. You lose Elo when you lose. The calculation is based on the <strong>Q-TTR system</strong> of the German Table Tennis Association. Your Elo value significantly determines your rank.</li><li><strong>Effort (XP):</strong> These are your permanent experience points. You gain XP for almost everything: attendance, exercises, challenges and match wins. <strong>XP is never deducted</strong> - you can only gain it! XP (just like Elo) is necessary for your rank advancement. However, penalties for unsportsmanlike behavior can also cost XP (see below).</li><li><strong>Season Points:</strong> These points are only for the \"Season Competition\" (every 6 weeks). They are awarded for attendance, exercises, challenges and matches. Unlike XP, you can lose Season Points from match losses or penalties. At the end of the season they are reset.</li></ul>",

      "singlesPoints": "<p>When you play a competitive match (no handicap match), your <strong>Elo points</strong> and your <strong>Season Points</strong> are adjusted. Your <strong>XP</strong> can only increase.</p><ul class=\"list-disc list-inside mt-2 space-y-1\"><li><strong>Win:</strong> You gain Elo points, Season Points and XP.</li><li><strong>Loss:</strong> You lose Elo points and Season Points. You do <strong>not</strong> lose XP.</li><li><strong>Fairness:</strong> If you win against a stronger player (higher Elo), you receive more points. If you lose against a stronger player, you only lose a few points.</li></ul><p class=\"mt-2\"><strong>Important for Recruits:</strong> As a Recruit (lowest rank) you must first complete <strong>5 basic exercises</strong> before you are allowed to play competitive matches. This ensures you have mastered the basics!</p>",
